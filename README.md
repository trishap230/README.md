## Email Project

### Objective:
To generate AI responses to emails, given past email data. These emails will model after the person who wrote the emails from the data.


### Minimum Viable Product (MVP): 
- Users are able to upload past email data
- The product will use data in order to generate an AI model which takes after the style of old emails
- The user won't have to spend too much time writing emails after implementing the product


### Stretch Goals:
#### Easy: 
- Adding the name of the person to respond to and a signature
#### Medium:
- Implementing the use of questions in the email (complex, not "how are you?")
#### Hard:
- Since we are using the data from a specific person's email, it would be harder to allow this model to respond to emails of another person
